# asp_for_work
asp with wcf with a touch of jquery ui

create a folder with a name of asp_for_work and then copy all the files into the folder

to use it start visual studio (i use 2013 when creating this one)
then click file,open,website then choose the folder

to start just click the compile (this looks like a play button near the undo)

to use it as you see the table just click select near the record you want to select then make any changes then click update

to delete is the same process with update but after selecting just click delete

insert is a bit different (if you see the id row in details section) there is a textbox this will be ignored in update or delete but use this one for inserting
